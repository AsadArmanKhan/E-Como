# Vite + React — Starter Template

A minimal, fast starter template for building React applications with Vite. This project includes a recommended developer setup with ESLint, a sensible project structure, and example components/pages to help you get started quickly.

Key technologies

- Vite — fast build tool with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- React — UI library
- ESLint — linting and code quality

If you prefer TypeScript, use the Vite React TypeScript template to add type-aware linting and configuration.

## Features

- Fast development server with HMR
- Minimal, production-ready build with Vite
- ESLint configuration for consistent code style
- Example components, pages and static assets to demonstrate structure

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.18+ or 16+
- npm (or Yarn / pnpm)

## Quick Start

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
# from the project root
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production and preview the build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes for PowerShell users (Windows):

```powershell
# remove node_modules and reinstall
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules; npm install
```

## Available Scripts

- `dev` — start Vite dev server with HMR
- `build` — create a production build
- `preview` — preview the production build locally
- `lint` — run ESLint (if configured in `package.json`)

Replace `npm` with `yarn` or `pnpm` if you use a different package manager.

## Project Structure

Key files and folders:

- `index.html` — application HTML entry
- `package.json` — scripts and dependencies
- `vite.config.js` — Vite configuration
- `src/` — source files
  - `main.jsx` — app entry (ReactDOM render)
  - `App.jsx` — root React component
  - `index.css`, `App.css` — styles
  - `Components/` — reusable UI components (Header, Footer, Sidebar, etc.)
  - `Pages/` — page-level components (views)
  - `data/` — sample data used by demo pages
- `public/` — static assets (images, icons)

This template ships with example components and pages modeled as a simple storefront to show typical patterns.

## ESLint and Formatting

An ESLint configuration is included. Consider adding Prettier for formatting and Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit checks:

- `npm run lint` — run ESLint
- `prettier --write` — format files (if Prettier is added)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`.
3. Implement your changes and test locally.
4. Run linter/formatters and add tests if relevant.
5. Open a pull request describing the change.

For larger changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

## Troubleshooting

- If the dev server fails to start: confirm Node.js version and reinstall dependencies.
- If you see unexpected styling or asset issues: check `public/` and imported paths in `src/`.
- Port conflicts: set `PORT` env var or pass `--port` to Vite in the `dev` script.

## License

This template contains no license file by default. Add a `LICENSE` file (for example, MIT or Apache-2.0) if you plan to publish.
